			<span class="byline">a short story by me</span>
			<p>For most of college I was a good little history nerd. The only place I risked getting kicked out of on a Friday night was the library; it closed at 10:00 which was lame. Everyday, breakfast was 7:00 sharp. I'd have fifty minutes of quiet to study unless, heaven forbid, one of my friends woke up at the same unholy hour to cram for a test and sat next to me. In most cases, saving the most earnest last minute crammer, all supposed studying paused. Thankfully the library opened at 8:00 and I could restart my silent, one person basement party.<br><br>Then a brewery opened up downtown at the end of my junior year and I discovered good beer. This turned out to be an expensive hobby so I stopped cutting my hair to save money, or something like that. Then I told myself that brewing my own beer would be cheaper than going to the brewpub but I ended up doing both. My buddies and I started cobbling together pots, hoses, and bags of grain transforming our kitchen into a mad lab. You could still find me in the dining hall at 7:00 most mornings albeit a little groggy and with a beer history book in hand.<br><br>There's a saying, "give a man a beer and he'll waste an hour, teach a man to brew and he'll waste a lifetime." In my experience neither are true. I graduated wanting to move out west, brew, and be outside. I've been lucky enough to do just that. I read chemistry articles about buffers, lived out of my car in Boonville, drove wherever the hiking was best, and met some unforgettable characters. Now I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because in all honesty my knees hurt, I like hiking a lot, and brewing is still an expensive hobby.</p>
